# NoteTaker #

## What it is:

This application allows users to input and save notes for easy viewing at a later time. The app uses Express.js to save note title and text on the back end to display on an html page.

## How to use:

The app can be initialized by running `npm start` or `node server.js` from the terminal. From there, the homepage can be viewed in the browser at ht<span>tp://localhost:3000/<span>.

Hitting the "Get Started" button will take users to a blank note template and a list of any saved notes. To add a note, the user will be prompted to enter a note title and body, which will bring up a floppy-disk "save" icon in the top corner. Saved notes can then be viewed by selecting from the list in the sidebar.
